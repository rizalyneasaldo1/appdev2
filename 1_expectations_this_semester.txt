>>>INTRODUCTION

	Hi, I’m Rizalyne Asaldo, a third-year student in BS Information Systems. As a third-year student, I know many programming languages such as HTML, CSS, JS, Python, Java, and PHP. However, what interests me the most are HTML and CSS, as they are the basics, unlike other programming languages. I don't have any experience in backend development, but if I pushed myself to code, I could focus on front-end development. Since I’m more interested in HTML and CSS, I also enjoy UI designing. I’m not that good at other programming languages, and I can't understand logic, so it’s hard for me to apply it in code.   



>>>COURSE  EXPECTATIONS

	What I want to achieve in this course is to learn how backend development works and understand how it helps make a system function. Since I already know about the front-end part of a system, I want to learn how the back-end works and connects to the front-end. 
	I believe learning backend development will help me with my studies and future career because systems aren’t just about the design and user interface; they also need the back-end to make everything work smoothly. 
	I don’t have much experience with backend development yet, but I’ve heard about APIs, and I think that’s a skill I would love to learn. I’m curious to find out what APIs are and how they work in backend development. Learning this will help me understand how different parts of a system talk to each other and share data. Gaining this knowledge will help me become a better developer and build systems that work well from both the front-end and back-end.
	Aside from APIs, I also want to learn about databases and how to store and manage data efficiently. I think understanding how to connect a database to a system is an important skill because almost every system relies on data storage and retrieval. By the end of this course, I hope to have a solid foundation in backend development and be able to create simple full-stack applications on my own.



>>>CHALLENGES AND AREAS FOR IMPROVEMENT

	I think one thing I struggled with and want to improve on this semester is handling errors. Dealing with errors happens often in coding and building systems, so it’s important to know how to manage them. 
	To get better at it, I need to learn more about what I’m doing and how everything works, so I can handle the errors more effectively. Solving errors by myself is helpful because it gives me a better understanding of the problem, but it can take up a lot of time and sometimes lead to even more problems if it’s not addressed correctly. Getting help when I run into errors can save time and help me solve the issue directly. Having support from my teacher or classmates during hands-on activities is really helpful. It’s better than relying on AI or looking up how to fix things online, because you get more immediate and specific advice that fits the problem at hand. 
	I also want to take notes on common errors I encounter and how to solve them, so I can refer back to them in the future or by any chance that I have a friend who ha encounter the same problem, I can help my friend. By doing this, I hope to become more confident and efficient in handling coding errors.



>>>EXPECTATION FROM THE INSTRUCTORS

	To the instructor of this course, I am satisfied with the way you teach. I like how the instructor demonstrates the code step by step, even handling errors on the spot, which helps students who might encounter the same problems. I also appreciate how everything is explained before starting the code and how each part of the code is connected to the others.
	However, nothing is perfect, and I believe there is still room for improvement. I am the type of student who spends time watching recordings so I can go back and review what I might have missed while following the coding steps. Recordings are very important to me. Online classes help because I can follow along on my device, but sometimes, I focus more on tracing the steps rather than understanding the purpose of the code. Because of this, I suggest slowing down a bit so we have time to think before catching up to your pace. Another suggestion, based on my personal learning style, is to explain the output of the code first before writing it. This way, we can fully understand what the code is for. Lastly, I think it would be helpful to highlight each step or provide a summary at the end.



>>>FINAL THOUGHTS

	As for my final thoughts, I know in myself that I can do front-end developer in the future, but hoping to grow and change my mind will change. My goal is not to become a professional in backend development but to deepen my knowledge so I can better understand how the system works.
